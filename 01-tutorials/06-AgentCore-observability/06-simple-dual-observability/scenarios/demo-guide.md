# Demo Guide: Running Observability Demonstrations

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running demonstrations of the dual observability setup with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, CloudWatch, and Braintrust. Use this to showcase the system in action and understand how observability data flows.

## Overview

Three demonstration scenarios show different aspects of the observability system:

- **Scenario 1**: Successful multi-tool query with complex reasoning - shows normal operation
- **Scenario 2**: Error handling and recovery - shows error visibility in both platforms
- **Scenario 3**: Dashboard review - walks through CloudWatch and Braintrust dashboards

### Quick Start - Run All Scenarios

```bash
# Run all three scenarios in sequence (recommended for demos)
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario all

# Run individual scenarios
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario success    # Scenario 1
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario error      # Scenario 2
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario dashboard  # Scenario 3

# With explicit agent ID
uv run python simple_observability.py --agent-id $AGENTCORE_AGENT_ID --scenario all
```

## Scenario 1: Successful Multi-Tool Query

### Purpose
Demonstrate successful agent execution with multiple tool calls, showcasing how traces flow through both CloudWatch and Braintrust.

### Query
```
What's the weather in Seattle and calculate the square root of 144?
```

### How to Run

```bash
# Run the successful query scenario
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario success

# Or with explicit agent ID
uv run python simple_observability.py --agent-id $AGENTCORE_AGENT_ID --scenario success
```

### Expected Behavior

#### Agent Execution Flow
1. **Input Processing** (0-2 seconds)
   - Agent receives user query
   - Initializes conversation with Claude
   - Braintrust creates parent span for entire conversation
   - CloudWatch records initial request metric

2. **Tool Selection** (2-5 seconds)
   - Agent analyzes query and identifies two tasks
   - Decides to call both tools
   - Creates child spans in Braintrust for each tool call
   - CloudWatch records tool usage metrics

3. **Weather Tool Execution** (5-8 seconds)
   - get_weather tool called with location="Seattle"
   - Returns: "72 degrees and sunny"
   - Braintrust records:
     - Tool name: get_weather
     - Input: {"location": "Seattle"}
     - Output: "72 degrees and sunny"
     - Duration: ~0.5 seconds
   - CloudWatch records:
     - ToolName dimension: get_weather
     - ToolCallDuration metric
     - ToolCallSuccess metric

4. **Calculator Tool Execution** (8-11 seconds)
   - calculate tool called with operation="sqrt", x=144
   - Returns: 12.0
   - Braintrust records:
     - Tool name: calculate
     - Input: {"operation": "sqrt", "x": 144}
     - Output: 12.0
     - Duration: ~0.5 seconds
   - CloudWatch records similar metrics

5. **Response Generation** (11-15 seconds)
   - Agent synthesizes final response
   - Combines both tool results
   - Returns natural language answer
   - Both systems record completion

#### Expected Console Output

```

#### Expected CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch receives traces and metrics from the AgentCore Runtime automatically via OpenTelemetry. Key observations:

**In CloudWatch GenAI Observability/APM Console:**
- Agent invocation count increments
- Latency recorded: ~11-15 seconds (including all tool calls and LLM processing)
- Tool execution times visible: weather tool ~500ms, calculator tool ~500ms
- Span details showing successful execution of both tools
- No errors recorded

**Note on Metrics:**
The namespace is `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore` (configured in OTEL settings). AgentCore Runtime automatically emits:
- Invocation counts
- Latency measurements
- Success/error status
- Tool execution details
- Span hierarchy and relationships

These metrics appear in CloudWatch GenAI Observability dashboard or APM console, not as custom metrics namespace.

#### Expected Braintrust Trace
```
Span Hierarchy:
└─ conversation_12345 [15.2s]
   ├─ model_call_1 [3.5s]
   │  └─ Input: "What's the weather in Seattle and calculate the square root of 144?"
   │  └─ Output: [tool_use blocks for get_weather and calculate]
   ├─ tool_get_weather [0.5s]
   │  └─ Input: {"location": "Seattle"}
   │  └─ Output: "72 degrees and sunny"
   ├─ tool_calculate [0.5s]
   │  └─ Input: {"operation": "sqrt", "x": 144}
   │  └─ Output: 12.0
   └─ model_call_2 [2.1s]
      └─ Input: [tool results]
      └─ Output: "The weather in Seattle is currently 72 degrees and sunny..."

Metadata:
  - Total Duration: 15.2s
  - Tool Calls: 2
  - Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
  - Success: true
```

### Viewing CloudWatch Logs

Use the `check_logs.sh` script to view agent execution logs:

```bash
# View logs from the last 30 minutes
scripts/check_logs.sh --time 30m

# Follow logs in real-time while running the demo
scripts/check_logs.sh --follow

# View logs from the last hour
scripts/check_logs.sh --time 1h
```

**What you'll see in the logs:**
- Agent initialization and startup messages
- Tool call invocations with input parameters
- Tool execution results and output
- Timing information for each operation
- OTEL trace export confirmations to CloudWatch and Braintrust
- Structured logging with log levels (INFO, DEBUG, etc.)

### Key Points to Highlight
- ✓ Both tools executed successfully
- ✓ Traces show complete execution flow
- ✓ CloudWatch metrics align with Braintrust spans

### Timing Estimate
Total demonstration time: 3-5 minutes
- Execution: ~15 seconds
- CloudWatch dashboard review: 1-2 minutes
- Braintrust trace review: 2-3 minutes

## Scenario 2: Error Handling

### Purpose
Demonstrate how the observability system captures and tracks errors, including partial failures and recovery.

### Query
```
Calculate the factorial of -5
```

### How to Run

```bash
# Run the error handling scenario
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario error

# Or with explicit agent ID
uv run python simple_observability.py --agent-id $AGENTCORE_AGENT_ID --scenario error
```

### Expected Behavior

#### Agent Execution Flow
1. **Input Processing** (0-2 seconds)
   - Agent receives query
   - Identifies calculator tool needed
   - Creates parent span in Braintrust

2. **Tool Call Attempt** (2-5 seconds)
   - calculate tool called with operation="factorial", x=-5
   - Tool validation detects invalid input (negative number)
   - Raises ValueError
   - Error captured in both systems

3. **Error Recording** (5-6 seconds)
   - Braintrust logs:
     - Span marked as error
     - Error type: ValueError
     - Error message: "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers"
     - Stack trace captured
   - CloudWatch logs:
     - ErrorCount: 1
     - ErrorType dimension: ValueError
     - ToolCallFailure: 1

4. **Agent Recovery** (6-10 seconds)
   - Agent may attempt to explain why operation failed
   - Returns user-friendly error message
   - Total trace still logged for analysis

#### Expected Console Output
```
2025-10-25 12:05:00,p12345,{simple_observability.py:200},INFO,

2025-10-25 12:05:05,p12345,{simple_observability.py:300},INFO,
Response: I apologize, but I cannot calculate the factorial of -5. The factorial function is only defined for non-negative integers.
2025-10-25 12:05:05,p12345,{simple_observability.py:305},INFO,Query completed in 5.3 seconds
2025-10-25 12:05:05,p12345,{simple_observability.py:320},INFO,Error metrics sent to CloudWatch
2025-10-25 12:05:05,p12345,{simple_observability.py:325},INFO,Error trace logged to Braintrust
```

#### Expected CloudWatch Metrics

CloudWatch receives traces showing the error scenario:

**In CloudWatch GenAI Observability/APM Console:**
- Agent invocation count increments
- Latency recorded: ~5-8 seconds (shorter due to error)
- Tool execution attempted: calculator tool
- Error status visible in trace
- Tool failed with validation error

**Error Tracking:**
The namespace is `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`. AgentCore Runtime records:
- Request that resulted in error
- Latency of the failed request
- Tool that failed and error details
- Status marked as failure/error
- Error details preserved in trace attributes

Error details are captured in the trace span attributes for debugging.

#### Expected Braintrust Trace
```
Span Hierarchy:
└─ conversation_12346 [5.3s] [ERROR]
   ├─ model_call_1 [2.5s]
   │  └─ Input: "Calculate the factorial of -5"
   │  └─ Output: [tool_use block for calculate]
   ├─ tool_calculate [0.2s] [ERROR]
   │  └─ Input: {"operation": "factorial", "x": -5}
   │  └─ Error: ValueError - Factorial is not defined for negative numbers
   │  └─ Stack trace: [full trace]
   └─ model_call_2 [1.5s]
      └─ Input: [error result]
      └─ Output: "I apologize, but I cannot calculate the factorial of -5..."

Metadata:
  - Total Duration: 5.3s
  - Tool Calls: 1
  - Tool Failures: 1
  - Error Type: ValueError
  - Success: false
```

### Viewing Error Logs

Use the `check_logs.sh` script to view error messages:

```bash
# View only ERROR messages from the last 15 minutes
scripts/check_logs.sh --errors

# View only ERROR messages from the last hour
scripts/check_logs.sh --time 1h --errors

# View all logs from the last 30 minutes (includes errors with context)
scripts/check_logs.sh --time 30m
```

**What you'll see in the error logs:**
- ERROR severity level in the log output
- Exact error message from the tool
- Error type (ValueError, etc.)
- Stack trace with file and line number information
- Context around the failure (what was attempted)
- How the agent recovered and responded to the user

### Key Points to Highlight
- ✓ Errors captured in both systems
- ✓ Error details preserved (type, message, stack trace)
- ✓ Metrics differentiate success vs failure
- ✓ Agent handles error gracefully
- ✓ Full context available for debugging via check_logs.sh
- ✓ Easy filtering to see only errors when troubleshooting

### Timing Estimate
Total demonstration time: 3-4 minutes
- Execution: ~6 seconds
- Error metric review: 1-2 minutes
- Trace analysis: 2 minutes

## Scenario 3: Dashboard Review

### Purpose
Walk through both CloudWatch and Braintrust dashboards to show comprehensive observability coverage.

### How to Run

For Scenario 3, you don't execute queries - you navigate and review the dashboards. However, you should have run Scenarios 1 and 2 first to generate data:

```bash
# First, run Scenario 1 to generate successful query traces
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario success

# Then run Scenario 2 to generate error traces
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario error

# Scenario 3 uses the data from the above runs
uv run python simple_observability.py --scenario dashboard
